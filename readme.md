# Patatap Demo

This is a demo project inspired by the (amazing) portable animation and sound kit, Patatap (https://patatap.com/)

The project is created using 
* Paper.js (http://paperjs.org/about/), 
* Howler.js (https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js#documentation), 
* HTML and CSS

Press any key A-Z and the screen will play a small animation and a sound associated with the key.
